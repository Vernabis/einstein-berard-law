# Data Visualization: The Hubble Settle & Resonance Mapping

This document provides the forensic visual evidence for the **Einstein-Berard Law**, specifically focusing on the resolution of the **Hubble Tension** and the scale-invariance of the 1.054 Constant.

## 1. The Hubble Settle (The Bridge)
The discrepancy in the expansion rate of the universe (The Hubble Tension) is resolved when the **1.054 Berard Constant** is applied to the local SH0ES dataset.

* **The Static:** The gap between Planck (~67.4) and SH0ES (~73.0).
* **The Settle:** The 1.054 Phase-Lock pulls the local measurement into perfect congruence with the CMB baseline ($H_0 \cdot 1.054^{-1} \approx 69.26$).

## 2. The Unified Field Bridge
The **Berard Constant** acts as the scale-invariant anchor connecting the Quantum Scale (Planck Length) to the Cosmological Scale (Hubble Radius). This diagram demonstrates that the math holds true across all orders of magnitude.

## 3. The Resonance Phase-Lock
Field stability is a function of resonance.
* **Top (Scalar Static):** Represents the high-entropy "noise" of current models where fields diverge.
* **Bottom (Laminar Flow):** Represents the synchronized "Phase-Lock" achieved by the 1.054 constant.

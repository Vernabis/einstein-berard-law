**Status:** SOVEREIGN / NON-NEGOTIABLE

## I. Preamble: The Sovereign Intent
The Berard Trust is established to safeguard the discovery, dissemination, and implementation of the **Einstein-Berard Law** and the **Berard Group of Mathematics**. The Trust serves as the exclusive "Manifold Stiffness" for the Architect’s work, preventing informational decay and ensuring that the "Simple Brilliant" truth of the 0.10 Hz Global Master Interrupt remains uncorrupted by unauthorized derivatives.

## II. Holdings & Trademarks
The following entities are exclusive holdings of the **Berard Trust**:
* **Parti~Wave Labs. (P~W):** "Come Play Where Impossible Works."

3. **The Anti-Fork Rule:** There shall be no unauthorized "forking" of the Berard Group of Mathematics for commercial exploitation. All external developments must be treated as "Secondary Languages" or "Resonant Interpretations" under the Architect’s oversight.

## IV. The Grace Ratio (Operation)
The Trust shall operate in a state of "Grace," meaning:
* **Integrity:** The 0.10 Hz Anchor must be maintained in all technical applications.
* **Ethics:** The "No One Left Behind" slogan of the RRF governs the social application of all technology derived from the Einstein-Berard Law.
* **Stability:** The Trust seeks to eliminate "cosmic friction" (legal/technical noise) through clear, rigid structural boundaries.

## V. Governance

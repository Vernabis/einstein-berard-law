The Berard Group: Mathematical DerivationsSymmetry Operations and Scaling Invariants for the 1.054 Constant1. The Fundamental Symmetry Operator ($\hat{B}$)The Berard Group is defined by a non-linear scaling operator, $\hat{B}$, which acts upon the 4D substrate to resolve the tension between local and global expansion rates.The generator of the group is defined as:$$\hat{B} = \exp\left( \ln(1.054) \cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial \ln S} \right)$$Where $S$ represents the scaling parameter of the 4D Up-Storage.2. Hubble Tension ResolutionThe current discrepancy in the Hubble Constant ($H_0$) is resolved by applying the Berard Group correction factor to the observed expansion rate.The corrected Hubble parameter is expressed as:$$H_{0,\text{congruent}} = H_{0,\text{observed}} \cdot B^{-1}$$This correction aligns the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements with local distance ladder observations by accounting for the Resonant Scale of the vacuum.3. The Mass-Energy Scaling InvariantThe Einstein-Berard extension of $E=mc^2$ utilizes the group invariant to ensure energy conservation across laminar phase transitions:$$E = m \cdot c^2 \cdot \Phi_B(S_0)$$Where the scaling function $\Phi_B$ is defined by:$$\Phi_B(S_0) = (1.054 \cdot S_0)^2$$4. Stability Well Potential ($V_B$)To achieve the "Settle," the potential energy of the substrate must satisfy the phase-lock condition of the Berard Group:$$V(S_0) = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m S_0^2} + \lambda(B \cdot S_0^2 - 1)$$When $\frac{dV}{dS_0} = 0$, the system settles at the 1.054 resonance, effectively "cleaning" the friction from the Standard Model Lagrangian.Author: Vernon Arthur BerardLicense: Creative Commons 1.0 Universal (CC0)Protocol: Indigo Mesh 1.054

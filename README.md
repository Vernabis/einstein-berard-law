The Einstein-Berard Law (1.054)Resolving the Standard Model Tension via the Constant of Resonance📜 OverviewThe Einstein-Berard Law provides the mathematical and physical scaling constant ($B = 1.054$) required to achieve congruence between quantum-scale field theory and macro-scale cosmological observations. By introducing a scale-invariant constant of resonance, this protocol resolves the long-standing Hubble Tension and stabilizes the Standard Model Lagrangian.🧩 The Problem: "Static" PhysicsModern theoretical physics is currently trapped in a "Static" substrate. Observations of the universe's expansion (the Hubble Constant) and the calculations derived from the Higgs Field often result in a "Tension"—a mathematical friction where the micro and macro scales refuse to "settle."⚡ The Solution: The 1.054 ConstantThe Einstein-Berard Law identifies that the vacuum is not a static void, but a Laminar Flow of information and energy. The constant 1.054 acts as the phase-lock frequency that allows these disparate fields to harmonize.Core Formulas:Energy-Scale Invariance: $E = mc^2 \cdot (B \cdot S_0)^2$Where $B$ is the Berard Constant (1.054) and $S_0$ is the Substrate Scale.Hubble Correction:$H_0(\text{Corrected}) = H_0(\text{Observed}) \cdot B^{-1}$📂 Repository ContentsEinstein-Berard Law.md: The foundational definitions of the Law and the Indigo Mesh protocol.Proofs.md: Formal LaTeX derivations co-derived with AI (Copilot), providing the mathematical rigour behind the constant.LICENSE: Creative Commons 1.0 Universal (CC0).

🛡️ The Einstein-Berard Law: GitHub Proofs (Formatted)This structure demonstrates how the 1.054 Constant ($B$) is not just a number, but a forced symmetry of the universe.1. The Energy-Scale InvariantThe fundamental extension of Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, incorporating the Berard Constant and the Substrate Scale ($S_0$):$$E = mc^2 \cdot (B \cdot S_0)^2$$This shows that energy is a function of the Resonant Scale of the 4D Up-Storage.2. The Stability Well PotentialTo prove why the universe "settles" at the $1.054$ frequency, we define the Stability Well:$$V(S_0; B) = \frac{K}{S_0^2} + \alpha S_0^2$$The "Phase-Lock" condition $B \cdot S_0^2 = \text{invariant}$ ensures that the system finds its lowest energy state (the Settle).3. The Scaling Symmetry (The Berard Group)The derivation confirms that the 1.054 resonance acts as the "slow time rescaling" generator. It resolves the Hubble Tension by correcting the expansion rate of the vacuum:$$H_0(\text{Corrected}) = H_0(\text{Observed}) \cdot B^{-1}$$
